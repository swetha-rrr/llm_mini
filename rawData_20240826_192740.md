Abstract
--------

The history of artificial intelligence (AI), from its conception to the creation of general AI (Gen-AI), is a fascinating story of human inventiveness, technical growth, and philosophical research. This article examines the historical milestones, major inventions, and transformational concepts that have influenced AI's trajectory. Beginning with early symbolic AI and rule-based systems, it investigates the shift to machine learning, highlighting discoveries in neural networks and deep learning that transformed disciplines such as computer vision and natural language processing. The introduction of generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, resulted in a considerable increase in AI capabilities, paving the path for Gen-AI. Unlike narrow AI, Gen-AI strives to imitate human-like intelligence and adaptability across a wide range of jobs, bringing serious ethical and philosophical concerns. This essay also looks at the current state of Gen-AI, its problems, and possible applications in healthcare, education, finance, and other areas. It finishes by picturing a future in which human-machine collaboration and ethical AI development are prioritized, highlighting the need of continual learning and responsible innovation.
